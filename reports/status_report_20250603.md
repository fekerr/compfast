# Project Status Report - 2025-06-03

This report summarizes the development progress on the quaternion implementations and related utilities.

## Modules Implemented

### 1. Original Quaternion (`quaternion_explorer/`)
*   **Purpose**: Initial exploration of quaternion concepts.
*   **Implementation Details**:
    *   `Quaternion` class with components `a, b, c, d` (integers).
    *   Operations: multiplication, squared norm calculation, primality testing (Lipschitz primes where norm squared is a rational prime and components are coprime).
    *   Components `a,b,c,d` were derived from Gaussian primes (real or imaginary parts).
    *   Used `gaussian_primes.py` for generating Gaussian primes.
*   **Status**: Submitted. Some challenges were encountered with file integrity during development, which were eventually addressed. Unit tests were created.

### 2. Alternative Quaternion (`q_alpha/`)
*   **Purpose**: Implement a quaternion variant using Gaussian Integers as coefficients, based on user-provided specifications.
*   **Implementation Details**:
    *   `IntegerGaussian` class (`integer_gaussian.py`): Represents `a + bj` where `a,b` are Python integers. Provides arithmetic operations for these numbers.
    *   `GaussianIntQuaternion` class (`gaussian_int_quaternion.py`): Represents `Q = w_coeff + x_coeff*i + y_coeff*j + z_coeff*k`, where each coefficient (`w_coeff`, `x_coeff`, etc.) is an `IntegerGaussian` object. Initialized using 8 integers `(p0, p1, ..., p7)` that map to the real and imaginary parts of these four `IntegerGaussian` coefficients.
    *   Operations: multiplication, conjugation, string representations.
*   **Status**: Submitted. Unit tests were created. Some test failures related to string representation and multiplication were being debugged when this module was last worked on. The string representation issue was believed to be resolved, but final test confirmation was pending.

### 3. Prime Parameter Iterator (`iterPrimes/`)
*   **Purpose**: Generate lists of prime numbers to be used as parameters for instantiating quaternion objects.
*   **Implementation Details**:
    *   `prime_utils.py`: Contains a prime generator `yield_primes(start_prime)`.
    *   `prime_parameter_iterator.py`: Contains the `PrimeParameterIterator` class.
        *   Takes `num_parameters` (length of list to yield) and `first_prime`.
        *   Generates parameters by exhausting combinations for a growing set of primes. For example, for `num_parameters=2`, `first_prime=3`:
            *   Using P=[3]: `[3,3]`
            *   Using P=[3,5]: `[3,3], [3,5], [5,3], [5,5]`
            *   Using P=[3,5,7]: `[3,3], [3,5], [3,7], [5,3], [5,5], [5,7], [7,3], [7,5], [7,7]`
            *   (And so on, yielding these lists sequentially across rounds).
*   **Status**: Submitted. Unit tests are passing. Includes a README.md.

## Current Date
2025-06-03

## Next Planned Steps
*   Develop a comparison framework in a new `compare_q_versions/` directory.
*   This framework will use the `PrimeParameterIterator` from `iterPrimes/` to generate parameters for both the original quaternion type (from `quaternion_explorer/`) and the alternative `GaussianIntQuaternion` (from `q_alpha/`).
*   Implement logic to instantiate both quaternion types and compare their properties or behaviors (e.g., string representations, results of arithmetic operations like multiplication).
