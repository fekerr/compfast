Here are some observations and potential issues with your `Makefile`:

1. **Inconsistent Use of Object Files in Targets**:
   - In the `$(TARGET)` rule, you're linking only `$(OBJS_x86_64)`, leaving out `$(OBJS_x86)`. If `$(TARGET)` is meant to combine both architectures, this is incomplete.

2. **Directory Management**:
   - You rely on `build_dir` to create necessary directories, but there’s no guarantee that this rule will be invoked before targets like `$(OBJS_x86)` or `$(OBJS_x86_64)`. You might want to include `$(build_dir)` as a prerequisite for every target that depends on its existence.

3. **Ambiguity in Multi-Architecture Output**:
   - Having one `TARGET` (`build/sum`) for both architectures could cause confusion or overwriting. It might be better to split targets (e.g., `build/x86/sum` and `build/x86_64/sum`).

4. **Cleaning Assumptions**:
   - The `clean` rule removes the `build` directory entirely. This could inadvertently delete manually added files. You might want to be more specific by cleaning only the relevant files.

5. **Redundant Compilation Commands**:
   - In rules like `build/x86/sum.o`, you compile the source file twice—once for the object and once for the assembly. You could streamline this by avoiding redundant recompilation or using intermediate files more efficiently.

6. **Missing Dependency Tracking**:
   - There’s no dependency generation for `.o` files, meaning changes in headers won’t trigger rebuilds. Consider using `-MMD` or `-MP` flags to generate `.d` files for dependency tracking.

7. **Hardcoding Architectures**:
   - The architectures (`-m32` and `-m64`) are hardcoded, which may limit portability. Consider parameterizing this for easier scaling.

Would you like me to rewrite or optimize this `Makefile` with the above fixes in mind?
