# Review: `rdtsc` (C Project)

This project demonstrates using the `RDTSC` instruction in C to measure CPU cycles.

## Source Code (`sum_rdtsc.c`)

*   **Clarity:** The code is generally clear and well-commented.
*   **`rdtsc()` function:** The inline assembly for `rdtsc` is standard.
*   **`exampleFunction()`:** Serves its purpose as a placeholder for work to be measured.
*   **`get_cpu_frequency()`:**
    *   Reads from `/proc/cpuinfo` which is a common approach but Linux-specific. Consider noting this dependency if portability is a concern.
    *   Error handling for `fopen` is present.
    *   The parsing of "cpu MHz" is straightforward.
*   **`main()` function:**
    *   Properly calls `rdtsc` before and after the `exampleFunction`.
    *   Calculates elapsed seconds based on CPU frequency.
    *   Prints results clearly.

## Makefile

*   **Organization:** The Makefile is well-structured with clear targets (`all`, `build_dir`, `intel_asm`, `disassemble`, `run`, `clean`).
*   **Compiler Flags:** Uses `-O3`, `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, `-Wpedantic`, which are good for optimization and warnings. `-Wl,-Map,build/sum.map` for generating a map file is useful for debugging.
*   **Assembly Generation:** Includes targets to generate AT&T (`ASMS_x86_64_att`) and Intel (`ASMS_x86_64_intel`) syntax assembly, which is a nice feature for analysis.
*   **`run` target:**
    *   Correctly attempts to set the CPU governor to `performance` for more stable measurements. This is a good practice.
    *   Requires `sudo` for `cpufreq-set`, which is typical. Users should be aware of this.
    *   Saves and restores the current governor, which is considerate.
*   **Pathing:** Uses `build/x86_64/` for object files and assembly. This is clear.
*   **Prerequisites:** The `copilot.md` (which acts as a README for this project) mentions `sudo apt-get install gcc make cpufrequtils`. This is helpful.

## Documentation (`rdtsc/copilot.md`)

*   The file `rdtsc/copilot.md` is a comprehensive README for this specific C project.
*   **Suggestion:** Consider renaming `rdtsc/copilot.md` to `rdtsc/README.md` for standard practice and discoverability. This would make it the default document shown by Git hosting platforms when browsing the directory.

## General Notes

*   The project is a good, focused example of using `RDTSC`.
*   The use of `cpufrequtils` in the `run` target is a good addition for benchmarking.
