# Repository Review: `compfast`
**Reviewed by:** jules.google.com
**Date:** 2024-07-30
**Version:** https://jules.google.com/task/15523307002962920642

## General Observations

* The repository seems to be a collection of small projects or examples, possibly related to the content at https://computers-are-fast.github.io/.
* Currently, there are three main sub-directories: `rdtsc`, `rdtsc_example`, and `sum_c`.
* Each sub-directory contains its own project, Makefile, and some form of README/notes in Markdown format.

## Main `README.md` Suggestions

The current main `README.md` only contains the repository name and a link to `https://computers-are-fast.github.io/`. To improve clarity and help users understand the repository's purpose and contents, consider the following enhancements:

1.  **Overall Purpose:** Briefly explain the overall purpose of the `compfast` repository. Is it for personal experimentation, code examples for the website, benchmarks, etc.?
2.  **Sub-project Overview:** Include a section that lists and briefly describes each sub-project (`rdtsc`, `rdtsc_example`, `sum_c`).
    *   For each sub-project, mention its language (C, Rust) and its primary goal (e.g., "Demonstrates RDTSC usage in C", "Rust RDTSC example", "Simple C sum algorithm").
3.  **Navigation:** Provide links to the individual README files within each sub-project for more detailed information (once they are standardized to `README.md`).
4.  **General Build/Run Instructions:** If there are any common prerequisites or general instructions applicable to all or most projects, mention them here. Otherwise, state that each project has its own build instructions in its respective directory.
5.  **Contribution/Feedback:** If applicable, mention how others can contribute or provide feedback.

## Structure and Organization

* The current structure of having separate directories for each project is good and keeps things organized.
* The existing Markdown files within each project (`copilot.md`, `readme_sum.md`) serve as good specific READMEs. It would be beneficial to rename them to `README.md` within their respective directories for consistency and standard practice. (This is planned).
