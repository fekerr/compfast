This project provides a Rust implementation for measuring CPU cycles using `RDTSC`, similar to the C version in the `rdtsc` directory.

## Source Code (`src/main.rs`)

*   **Clarity:** The code is generally well-structured and idiomatic Rust.
*   **`rdtsc()` function:** Uses inline assembly (`core::arch::asm!`) which is the standard way to access `RDTSC` in Rust for x86.
*   **`example_function()`:** Simple loop for demonstration, similar to the C version.
*   **`get_cpu_frequency()`:**
    *   Reads from `/proc/cpuinfo`, which, like the C version, is Linux-specific. Portability note applies here too.
    *   Uses `Result` for error handling, which is good Rust practice.
    *   File reading and parsing are done using standard Rust library features.
*   **`get_cpu_core()`:**
    *   Uses `libc::sched_getcpu` to get the current CPU core. This is a good addition for understanding the execution context.
    *   Returns `Result` for error handling.
*   **`print_cpu_info()`:**
    *   Provides more detailed CPU information by parsing `/proc/cpuinfo`. This is a useful utility.
*   **`main()` function:**
    *   Well-structured with clear printing of frequency, core, and timing results.
    *   Calculates an estimated number of iterations for 1 second, which is an interesting metric.

## `Cargo.toml`

*   **Dependencies:** Includes `libc = "0.2"` which is necessary for `sched_getcpu`.
*   **Edition:** The project has been updated to use the **Rust 2021 edition**, which is a good practice.

## Makefile

*   **Enhanced Functionality:** The Makefile has been significantly enhanced:
    *   **`build` target:** Compiles the project in release mode and now also sets `RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm -g"` to generate assembly code alongside the compilation.
    *   **`disassemble` target:** A new comprehensive target that:
        *   Creates a `disassembly/` directory.
        *   Uses `llvm-objdump --source --disassemble` to generate detailed, source-annotated disassembly for the main executable (`target/release/rdtsc_example`) and saves it to `disassembly/rdtsc_example_disassembly.txt`.
        *   Generates a map file using `nm target/release/rdtsc_example > disassembly/rdtsc_example_map.txt`.
        *   Disassembles `.rlib` dependencies from `target/release/deps/` into the `disassembly/` directory.
    *   **`run` target:** Now depends on the `disassemble` target (ensuring up-to-date disassembly) and executes `cargo run --release`, piping the output to `run_output.txt` using `tee`.
    *   **`clean` target:** Removes `cargo clean` artifacts and the `disassembly` directory.
    *   **`help` target:** Displays help information for the Makefile targets.
*   **No CPU Governor Control:** Similar to the C project's Makefile, this one doesn't attempt to set the CPU governor to `performance`. For more consistent benchmark results, users should consider setting it manually or enhancing the script.

## Documentation (`rdtsc_example/copilot.md`)

*   The file `rdtsc_example/copilot.md` serves as a detailed README for this Rust project, including setup instructions.
*   **Suggestion:** Similar to the C project, consider renaming `rdtsc_example/copilot.md` to `rdtsc_example/README.md` for consistency and standard practice.

## General Notes

*   This is a good Rust counterpart to the C `rdtsc` example, now with improved build tooling for inspection.
*   The inclusion of CPU core information and the 1-second iteration estimate are nice additions.
*   The update to Rust 2021 edition is a positive step.
*   Manual CPU governor setting is advisable for benchmarking.
