# Review of `pythons/` Directory

This document contains an initial review of the `pythons/` directory and its contents.

## Apparent Purpose

The `pythons/` directory appears to be a collection of scripts related to testing and benchmarking different Python interpreter implementations available on the system. This includes standard CPython (`python`, `python3`), PyPy, MicroPython, and CircuitPython.

The scripts aim to:
- Discover available Python interpreters.
- Measure their execution time for a simple loop.
- Collect version information for each interpreter.
- Output the collected data in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet).

## Observations on Scripts

- **Script Naming and Iteration:**
    - `allpytimings.py`: Seems to be a primary script for collecting and saving Python interpreter timings.
    - `apt010.py`: Appears to be a slightly modified or alternative version of `allpytimings.py`. The "apt" prefix and numbering (010) suggest it might be part of an iterative development process or a specific variant. The key difference seems to be in how it retrieves versions for MicroPython and CircuitPython, and a more compact summary print format.
    - `doit.sh`: A shell script that likely orchestrates the execution of some of these Python scripts and possibly other commands (e.g., `allmuver.sh`, which is not provided but mentioned). It also directly times `micropython` and `pypy` using the `loop.py` script (also not provided).
    - `gen_001.py`: A utility script to generate and delete a temporary Python script (`loop.py` or similar, based on the default content) used for the timing tests. This suggests a mechanism to create a standardized test workload.

- **Functionality:**
    - The Python scripts (`allpytimings.py`, `apt010.py`) create a temporary Python script that performs a simple loop, then execute this temporary script with different interpreters found on the system.
    - They use `/usr/bin/time -p` to measure the real execution time.
    - They attempt to gather version information for each interpreter.
    - They save the results in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet), indicating a need for data analysis and sharing.

- **Dependencies:**
    - The scripts rely on `pandas`, `pyarrow` for data manipulation and file format generation.
    - `whereis` command is used to find interpreter paths.
    - `/usr/bin/time` is used for timing.

## Initial Thoughts on Organization and Redundancy

- **Potential Redundancy:** `allpytimings.py` and `apt010.py` are very similar. It would be worth investigating if they can be merged or if the differences justify separate files. If `apt010.py` is an improved version, the older one might be obsolete.
- **Missing Files:** The `doit.sh` script refers to `allmuver.sh` and `loop.py`, which were not part of the reviewed file set. Their absence makes it harder to fully understand the workflow.
- **Clarity of Purpose:** While the general purpose is clear, the specific evolution or reason for multiple similar scripts (like `allpytimings.py` vs `apt010.py`) could be better documented.
- **Temporary Script Management:** `gen_001.py` is used to create and delete the test script. The main timing scripts (`allpytimings.py`, `apt010.py`) also create and delete a `temp_runtime_script.py`. This suggests some duplication of effort or perhaps different stages of development.

## Conclusion

This is an initial review based on the provided file listing and content. A more detailed analysis of each script, understanding the missing referenced files (`allmuver.sh`, `loop.py`), and potentially running the scripts in their intended environment would be necessary for a full and comprehensive review. The primary goal of this directory seems to be benchmarking Python interpreters.

Key areas for further investigation:
- Clarify the relationship and necessity of `allpytimings.py` and `apt010.py`.
- Understand the role of `doit.sh` and the missing `allmuver.sh` and `loop.py`.
- Evaluate the management of temporary scripts.
- Ensure all necessary dependencies are documented.
