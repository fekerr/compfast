# Jules Activity Log

## Entry: 2023-10-27 (Placeholder Date) - Project Initialization and Foundational Features

This log entry summarizes the significant development phases and features implemented in the Python Profiling Framework project with assistance from Jules, up to the changes associated with branch `jules20250525-cicd-hotfix`. (User can refer to their Git log for specific commit hashes for this branch).

### I. Initial Project Setup & Core Structure
*   **Project Skeleton:** Standard Python layout, CLI entry point (`main.py`), `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`.
*   **Modular Design:** Code organized into `./modules`, `./decorators`, `./workloads`, `./tests`.
*   **CLI:** Basic `argparse` implementation in `main.py` for `run_workload <workload_name>`.

### II. Key Functionalities Implemented
*   **Workload Execution:** Framework to run scripts from `workloads/`.
    *   *Examples:* `sample_workload.py`, `cpu_intensive_workload.py`, `io_bound_workload.py`, `prime_minimal_branching_workload.py` (Segmented Sieve).
*   **Profiling Decorators (`decorators/profiling.py`):**
    *   `@time_it`: Measures and logs function execution time.
    *   `@memory_profile_it`: Measures and logs function memory usage (using `memory_profiler`).
*   **Unit Testing (`tests/`):**
    *   `pytest` framework. Tests for example module, profiling decorators, and prime workload logic.

### III. Development Lifecycle & Configuration
*   **CI/CD (GitHub Actions - `.github/workflows/python_ci.yml`):**
    *   Triggers on push/pull_request to `main`.
    *   Tests on Python 3.12 and latest 3.x.
    *   Includes Flake8 linting and Pytest execution with `pytest-cov` for coverage reports (terminal & XML).
*   **Configuration (`config.toml`):**
    *   Manages application settings like `log_level`. Loaded by `main.py`.
*   **Application Logging (`modules/app_logging.py`):**
    *   Python `logging` module. Logs to console and daily rotating files in `jules/` (e.g., `jules/app_YYYYMMDD.log`). Log level set from `config.toml`.
*   **Auxiliary Files:**
    *   `jules/`: For application runtime logs.
    *   `todo.toml`: Conceptual manual tracker for problematic features/tests.
    *   `DESIGN_NOTES.md`: For future considerations (multi-language, GPU).

### IV. Recent Updates (Branch: `jules20250525-cicd-hotfix`)
*   Updated CI Python versions to 3.12 and "3.x".
*   Corrected a `SyntaxError` in `tests/test_prime_minimal_branching.py`.

### V. Current Status & Known Issues (from last local validation)
*   **Linting:** While the critical `SyntaxError` is fixed, numerous Flake8 style warnings remain across various files. These should be addressed for improved code quality.
*   **Test Coverage:** Last reported at approximately 14%. This is very low. Key modules (`main.py`, `modules/app_logging.py`) have 0% coverage. Significant effort is needed to write more comprehensive unit tests.
*   **External User Issue:** User reported a "Failing to apply patch?" error when using their Git UI's "publish branch" feature (external to Jules' operations).

This log aims to provide a snapshot of development progress. Future entries will detail subsequent changes.
