No, the `--emit asm` option in Rust does not include interspersed Rust source lines in the generated assembly. The assembly files produced by this option contain the raw assembly code without any annotations or comments from the original Rust source code.

If you want to include interspersed source lines in the assembly, you might need to use additional tools or methods. One approach is to use the `llvm-objdump` tool with specific flags to disassemble the compiled binary and interleave the source code.

### **Using llvm-objdump with Source Lines**

Here's how you can update the Makefile to use `llvm-objdump` to include interspersed Rust source lines:

### **Updated Makefile**

```makefile
# Makefile for RDTSC example in Rust

# Build the project and generate assembly files
build:
	RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm -g" cargo build --release

# Generate objdump disassembly and map files with source lines
disassemble: build
	# Create the disassembly directory if it doesn't exist
	mkdir -p disassembly
	# Disassemble the binary
	llvm-objdump --source --disassemble target/release/rdtsc_example > disassembly/rdtsc_example_disassembly.txt
	# Create a map file
	nm target/release/rdtsc_example > disassembly/rdtsc_example_map.txt
	# Generate object dump for dependencies
	for file in target/release/deps/*.o; do llvm-objdump --source --disassemble $$file > disassembly/$$(basename $$file).disassembly.txt; done

# Run the project
run: disassemble
	cargo run --release

# Clean up generated files
clean:
	cargo clean
	rm -rf disassembly
```

### **Explanation:**

- **llvm-objdump**: We use `llvm-objdump` with the `--source` and `--disassemble` flags to include interspersed source lines in the disassembly.
- **Create the disassembly directory**: Ensure the directory exists before generating files.
- **Generate disassembly**: Use `llvm-objdump` to generate disassembly with source lines for both the main binary and dependencies.

### **Steps to Build and Run:**

1. **Ensure the `target` and `disassembly` directories are clean**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

2. **Build the project and generate assembly files**:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. **Generate disassembly and map files with source lines**:
   ```bash
   make disassemble
   ```

4. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

This will produce assembly files with interspersed Rust source lines in the `disassembly` directory.
