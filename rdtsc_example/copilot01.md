Got it! Let's modify the `Makefile` to include steps for generating the objdump disassembly and including map files. We will also add debug information to the binary for better analysis.

### **Updated Makefile**

```makefile
# Makefile for RDTSC example in Rust

# Build the project and generate assembly files
build:
	RUSTFLAGS="--emit asm -g" cargo build --release

# Generate objdump disassembly and map files
disassemble: build
	# Create the disassembly directory if it doesn't exist
	mkdir -p disassembly
	# Disassemble the binary
	objdump -d target/release/rdtsc_example > disassembly/rdtsc_example_disassembly.txt
	# Create a map file
	nm target/release/rdtsc_example > disassembly/rdtsc_example_map.txt
	# Generate object dump for dependencies
	for file in target/release/deps/*.o; do objdump -d $$file > disassembly/$$(basename $$file).disassembly.txt; done

# Run the project
run: disassemble
	cargo run --release

# Clean up generated files
clean:
	cargo clean
	rm -rf disassembly
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Build with debug information**: We added `-g` to `RUSTFLAGS` to include debug information in the binary.
- **Disassembly and map files**: The `disassemble` target generates the objdump disassembly and map files.
  - Creates a `disassembly` directory.
  - Disassembles the main binary and places the output in `disassembly/rdtsc_example_disassembly.txt`.
  - Creates a map file using `nm` and places it in `disassembly/rdtsc_example_map.txt`.
  - Disassembles object files for dependencies and places the output in the `disassembly` directory.

### **Steps to Build and Run:**

1. **Ensure the `target` and `disassembly` directories are clean**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

2. **Build the project and generate assembly files**:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. **Generate disassembly and map files**:
   ```bash
   make disassemble
   ```

4. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

This setup will compile the project with debug information, generate assembly files, create objdump disassembly, and generate map files. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to let me know! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
